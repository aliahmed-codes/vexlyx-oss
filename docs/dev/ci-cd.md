# F6.2 — CI/CD Pipeline

## What it does

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request and every push to `main`: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `build` as four separate jobs, so a failure points straight at the cause.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs when a tag matching `v*` is pushed: it re-runs CI, creates a GitHub release with generated notes, and builds and pushes the Docker images to GHCR.
- **Changelog** is generated from Conventional Commits by [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org), configured in `cliff.toml`.

## How it works

Each CI job installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (Node 22, pnpm version from `packageManager`), then runs the matching root script (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`), which Turborepo maps to the workspaces. Typecheck, test and build run `prisma generate` first with a placeholder `DATABASE_URL` (generation never connects), the same trick as `system/scripts/install/steps/09-build.sh`. `@vexlyx/shared` is built by Turborepo's `^build` dependency. The API tests are mocked unit tests and need no Postgres or Redis; the Python suites under `tests/` need live Docker services and are not run in CI.

Release images, published to `ghcr.io/atlantiqshq/`:

| Image | Dockerfile | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vexlyx-dashboard` | `apps/dashboard/Dockerfile` | Self-contained Next.js standalone image. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked in at build time, so the published image uses the defaults. |
| `vexlyx-api` | `apps/api/Dockerfile` | Runtime toolchain only (Node, Python, Docker CLI, Nixpacks). By design it ships no app code; the installer bind-mounts the host build. |

Tags: `X.Y.Z`, plus `X.Y` and `latest` for stable tags. A tag containing `-` (for example `v1.0.0-rc.1`) is a prerelease: it gets a prerelease GitHub release and no `latest` tag.

## Cutting a release

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Keep commit messages in `type(scope): summary` form so they land in the right changelog section. To refresh the committed `CHANGELOG.md`, run `git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md` locally after tagging and commit it.

## Branch protection

Once CI is stable, require the `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `build` checks on `main` in the repository settings (and `Docs / build` for docs changes).

## How to test

Open a pull request and check that all four jobs pass. To test a release, push a prerelease tag such as `v0.0.1-rc.1`, confirm the release and both images appear, then delete the tag, release and package versions.

## How to extend

- Dashboard tests use Vitest (`apps/dashboard/vitest.config.ts`, `src/**/*.test.ts`).
- Staging auto-deploy on merge is not implemented; add a job to `release.yml` or a new workflow when a staging server exists.
