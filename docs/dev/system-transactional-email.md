# System Transactional Email (F5.23)

The panel's own outbound email: password resets, security alerts, quota warnings and backup-failure notices. It works with **no operator configuration** — mail is sent as `notifications@<your panel domain>` through the Postfix that ships with Vexlyx — and can be pointed at any external SMTP provider with a few environment variables.

This is separate from the customer mail-hosting stack ([Postfix](email/postfix.md), F4.1), which serves mailboxes for hosted domains. System email only *sends*, and only from the panel's own sender address.

## What gets emailed

| Event | Recipient | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password reset link | The account | `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` |
| Password changed | The account | A reset completes, or the user changes their password |
| Role changed | The account | An admin changes the role (`UserService.updateRole`) |
| 2FA enabled / disabled / reset | The account | `TwoFactorService` |
| Quota warning at 80% and 100% | The account | After a project, domain, database, mailbox or sub-account is created |
| Backup failed | Every admin | A backup job ends in `FAILED` |

"New login from an unrecognized location" is **not** included: it needs login history and IP geolocation, which the panel does not keep yet.

## How it works

              OpenDKIM signs notifications@MAIL_DOMAIN                 Resend, Postmark, SES, Mailgun, ...
```

- `modules/system-email/notifier.ts` is a module-level singleton, so any service sends a notification with one line and tests that never register it get a silent no-op.
- Sending is always queued, so a slow or unreachable SMTP server never blocks a request. Failures are retried, logged, and shown on the admin card.
- `modules/system-email/templates.ts` holds one typed function per event returning subject, plain text and a minimal HTML body. There is no template builder by design. Links are built from `PANEL_DOMAIN` (or `CORS_ORIGIN`), never from a request's `Host` header.
- On API start (bundled transport only) `ensureSenderIdentity()` calls the existing `generate_dkim` command in `postfix_manager.py` for `MAIL_DOMAIN`, which is idempotent, so OpenDKIM signs panel mail. The panel domain is not a customer `Domain`, so no database row is created.

## Password reset

1. `POST /api/auth/forgot-password { email }` always answers `202` with the same body, whether or not the email exists, and is limited to 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP. Per account it sends at most one email a minute (a Redis key) and never locks the account.
2. A 32-byte random token is created; only its SHA-256 is stored in `password_reset_tokens`. Any earlier unused link for that user is deleted, so the newest link wins.
3. The email links to `/reset-password#token=…`. The token is in the URL **fragment**, so it never reaches server logs or `Referer` headers. The page reads it, then removes it from the address bar.
4. `POST /api/auth/reset-password { token, newPassword }` checks the hash, expiry (30 minutes) and that it is unused, then claims it atomically (`updateMany … usedAt: null`) so two simultaneous requests cannot both win.
5. On success the password is re-hashed with Argon2id, **every session of that user ends** (`destroyUserSessions`), there is **no auto-login**, two-factor stays enforced, a "password changed" email is sent, and `user.password_reset` is written to the audit log.

`changePassword` also ends the user's *other* sessions and sends the same notice.

**Admin accounts are not email-resettable** unless `ALLOW_ADMIN_EMAIL_RESET=true`. An admin is root-equivalent on the host, so a compromised mailbox must not be enough to take one over. Server-side admin recovery is tracked in issue #19.

## Configuration

All variables are optional. See `apps/api/.env.example`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch. When `false`, nothing is queued. |
| `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` | `smtp` in production, `log` otherwise | `log` prints each message (including reset links) to the API log. Refused in production. |
| `MAIL_DOMAIN` | `PANEL_DOMAIN`, then `BASE_DOMAIN` (the production compose file sets it to the panel domain) | Domain of the sender address. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | `notifications@<MAIL_DOMAIN>` | Sender address. |
| `MAIL_REPLY_TO` | unset (the installer sets the admin email) | Where replies go. The sender address has no mailbox, so without this replies bounce. |
| `BUNDLED_SMTP_HOST` / `BUNDLED_SMTP_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `25` | Where the bundled Postfix is reached. The production compose file sets the host to `postfix`. |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `_PORT`, `_SECURE`, `_USER`, `_PASS` | unset (port `587`) | Use an external relay instead. User and password must be set together. |
| `ALLOW_ADMIN_EMAIL_RESET` | `false` | Allow password reset by email for admin accounts. |

The external-relay variables are named `EMAIL_SMTP_*` rather than `SMTP_*` because `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_PORT` are already used by the customer mail-hosting diagnostics.

### Why this sender address

Mail comes from the **panel (sub)domain**, e.g. `notifications@panel.example.com`, not the apex domain. A dedicated subdomain keeps the reputation of automated mail separate from your people's mail on the main domain. The local part is `notifications` rather than `noreply`, because mailbox providers (Outlook since 2024) treat no-reply senders less favourably; replies are redirected to the admin through `Reply-To`.

### Deliverability

Mail from your own server is only as trusted as the DNS behind it. For the bundled transport, publish an **SPF**, **DKIM** and **DMARC** record for `MAIL_DOMAIN`. **Settings → System Email** (admins) lists the exact values and checks them against public DNS, and the installer summary points there.

Two common blockers:

- **Outbound port 25 is blocked** by many VPS providers. If the status card shows connection errors, set `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` to a provider's SMTP endpoint. A provider also gives you IP reputation you don't have to earn.
- **A new server IP has no reputation.** Expect early mail to land in spam until SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass and the IP warms up.

## Admin API

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/system-email/status` | ADMIN only. Transport, sender, last success or error, required DNS records with a live check. |
| `POST` | `/api/system-email/test` | ADMIN only. Sends immediately (not queued) so the real error is returned. Audited as `system_email.test_sent`. |

## Data model

- `PasswordResetToken` — `tokenHash` (unique), `expiresAt`, `usedAt`, `requestIp`. Cascades with the user.
- `QuotaNotice` — one row per `(user, resource, level)` already warned about. Created when a warning is sent, removed when usage drops back under the threshold so it can fire again. Only a user's own limit is considered, not pooled reseller limits (F5.20).

## How to test

```bash
pnpm --filter @vexlyx/api test
```

Unit tests cover the templates, sender options, the token lifecycle (hashing, expiry, reuse, simultaneous use, newest-link-wins, admin gate), quota de-duplication and re-arming, response parity for known and unknown emails, 401/403 on the admin routes and the 429 rate limit.

By hand in development (`EMAIL_TRANSPORT=log` is the default): open `/forgot-password`, submit an email, and copy the link from the API log. To test real delivery, run the dev Postfix (`docker-compose up -d`) and set `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp`.

## How to extend

To add an event: add its name to `SYSTEM_EMAIL_EVENTS` in `packages/shared/src/schemas/systemEmail.ts`, its params and template in `modules/system-email/templates.ts` (the compiler flags a missing template), then call `notifyUser(event, to, params)` or `notifyAdmins(event, params)` where it happens and add a test.
